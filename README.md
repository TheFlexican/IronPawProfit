# IronPaw Profit Calculator v1.0.1

A World of Warcraft addon for Mists of Pandaria that helps you maximize your profits with Ironpaw Tokens. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools to analyze the market, generate tokens cheaply, and make the smartest purchasing decisions.

## Features

This addon is more than just a simple calculator.

### 1. Nam Ironpaw Profit Advisor
- **Core Functionality**: Calculates the potential profit from buying sacks of cooking materials from Nam Ironpaw in Halfhill.
- **Detailed UI**: A clear, sortable list shows you the profit per token, recommended stacks to buy, and total potential profit for each item.

### 2. Merchant Cheng Token Generation
- **Find the Cheapest Tokens**: Analyzes the cost of raw materials (fish, meat, vegetables) needed to generate Ironpaw Tokens through Merchant Cheng.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Compares the cost of generating tokens versus the potential profit from spending them, helping you decide when to craft and when to hold.
- **Token Arbitrage**: Identifies lucrative opportunities where the cost to generate a token is significantly lower than the value you can get from spending it on Nam Ironpaw's goods.

### 3. Greenfield Seed Planting Calculator
- **Maximize Your Farm**: Analyzes the market value of crops and calculates which seeds from Merchant Greenfield will yield the most profit when planted in your Tillers farm.
- **Yield Prediction**: Estimates the total profit based on the number of seeds you plan to plant.

### 4. User-Friendly Interface
- **Multi-Tabbed Window**: All features are organized into intuitive tabs for Nam Ironpaw, Merchant Cheng (Arbitrage & Raw Materials), and Greenfield Seeds.
- **At-a-Glance Summary**: Each tab provides a summary of the best opportunities.
- **Detailed Tooltips**: Hover over any item for a detailed breakdown of its market data and profit calculation.
